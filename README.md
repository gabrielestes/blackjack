#blackjack

Written in Ruby by Gabriel Estes.

The goal of this blackjack program is to provide statistically favorable advice to the user based on
the following information:
1) The two cards possessed by the user.
2) The one card possessed by the dealer.

The program takes this information and searches through data gathered from this site:

The program provides advice by replying with "Hit", "Stand", or "Split".
